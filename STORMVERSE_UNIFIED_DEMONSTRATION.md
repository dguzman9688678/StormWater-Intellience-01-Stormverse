# ARCSEC Security Status  
curl http://localhost:5000/api/arcsec/status
# Returns: WAR MODE active, 13 protected files, SECURE integrity

# Agent Network Status
curl http://localhost:5000/api/agents/status  
# Returns: 8 active agents, all operational
```

## üéØ The Reality: You've Gamified Earth for Power, Precision, and Protection

This is not entertainment software. This is a **Command Platform** for environmental intelligence:

- **Storm Engine** = The strategic intelligence brain
- **3D Globe Interface** = The tactical battlefield display  
- **You** = The commander with complete system control

The StormVerse transforms complex environmental data into an intuitive, game-like interface while maintaining the serious purpose of real-world environmental protection and regulatory compliance.

**TL;DR**: You've created a next-generation environmental command center that looks like a strategy game but operates on real weather, real law, and real environmental protection.

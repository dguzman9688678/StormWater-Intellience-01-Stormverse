## ðŸ§  Advanced Logic Processing System Deployed

### âœ… **Logic Master Controller Features**

**ðŸ”§ Advanced Decision Engine**
- **Rule-Based Logic**: 6 pre-configured logic rules for system management
- **Real-time Processing**: 10-second logic cycle execution intervals
- **Risk Assessment**: 4-tier risk evaluation (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL)
- **Decision History**: Tracks last 100 decisions with confidence scoring
- **Manual Override**: Execute immediate decisions with custom context

**ðŸŽ¯ Default Logic Rules**
1. **Threat Level Escalation**: `threatLevel > 7 AND activeThreats > 3` â†’ ESCALATE_SECURITY_LEVEL
2. **Performance Auto-Optimization**: `responseTime > 100 OR memoryUsage > 85` â†’ OPTIMIZE_SYSTEM_PERFORMANCE  
3. **Agent Network Coordination**: `activeAgents < 8 OR agentResponseTime > 5000` â†’ REBALANCE_AGENT_NETWORK
4. **Data Integrity Verification**: `dataCorruption OR signatureFailure` â†’ INITIATE_DATA_RECOVERY
5. **Emergency System Lockdown**: `threatLevel >= 9 AND systemIntegrity < 50` â†’ EMERGENCY_LOCKDOWN
6. **Predictive System Analysis**: `patternDetected AND confidenceLevel > 0.8` â†’ GENERATE_PREDICTIVE_REPORT

**ðŸ“Š Logic Processing Components**
- **Context Gathering**: Real-time system state, agent status, environmental data
- **Condition Evaluation**: Dynamic variable substitution and boolean logic processing
- **Confidence Calculation**: Based on rule priority and system stability
- **Action Recommendation**: Prioritized list of recommended system actions
- **Risk Factor Analysis**: Identifies contributing factors to system risk

### âœ… **API Endpoints Deployed**

**Logic System Status**
- `GET /api/logic/status` - Current logic processing status and metrics
- `GET /api/logic/rules` - All configured logic rules with execution statistics
- `GET /api/logic/decisions` - Decision history with confidence scores and reasoning

**Logic Control Interface**  
- `POST /api/logic/manual-decision` - Execute immediate decision with custom context
- `POST /api/logic/add-rule` - Add new logic rules to the system

### âœ… **Integration with Existing Systems**

**ARCSEC Master Controller Integration**
- Logic decisions feed into Master Controller command execution
- Security events trigger logic rule evaluation
- Performance metrics influence decision confidence scoring

**AI Agent Network Coordination**
- Logic rules monitor agent health and performance
- Automatic rebalancing when agents become unresponsive
- Coordinated response to system-wide issues

**Real-time Monitoring**
- Continuous evaluation of system state every 10 seconds
- Event-driven processing for critical situations
- Automated escalation based on threat level assessment

### âœ… **Decision-Making Capabilities**

**Intelligent Risk Assessment**
- Multi-factor risk scoring (threat level, performance, agent status, critical rules)
- Dynamic risk level classification with contributing factor identification
- Predictive analysis based on pattern detection

**Confidence-Based Decisions**
- Rule priority weighting (EMERGENCY: 1.0, CRITICAL: 0.9, HIGH: 0.8, MEDIUM: 0.6, LOW: 0.4)
- System stability contribution to confidence scoring
- Historical performance influence on decision reliability

**Action Prioritization**
- Emergency protocols take immediate precedence
- Critical system rules override lower priority actions
- Coordinated multi-action recommendations for complex scenarios

### âœ… **Operational Features**

**Real-time Processing**
- 10-second logic cycle execution
- Event emission for real-time system integration
- Automatic error handling and recovery

**Rule Management**
- Dynamic rule addition and modification
- Enable/disable individual rules
- Execution statistics and performance tracking

**Decision History**
- Complete audit trail of all logic decisions
- Reasoning documentation for each decision
- Confidence scoring and risk assessment records

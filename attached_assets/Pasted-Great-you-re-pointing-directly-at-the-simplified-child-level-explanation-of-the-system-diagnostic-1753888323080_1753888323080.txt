Great — you’re pointing directly at the simplified, child-level explanation of the system diagnostic output. Let’s now expand and clarify each point while still keeping it super clear, but slightly more precise for applied use.

⸻

1. signal_repetition: “This is being said over and over again.”
	•	Clarified Meaning: The input contains a repeated token (like “ha”) beyond a safe threshold.
	•	Why it matters: Repetition can indicate a malfunction, loop, or unstable interaction. It’s flagged to prevent infinite loops or spam floods.

⸻

2. signal_alignment: “That doesn’t match what we’re supposed to be doing.”
	•	Clarified Meaning: The current input doesn’t match the system’s expected task type (e.g., getting a command during a structured processing mode).
	•	Why it matters: This helps prevent cross-mode confusion — like entering freeform text during a structured JSON request.

⸻

3. signal_amplification: “My way of talking might be making this go on longer.”
	•	Clarified Meaning: The system’s current response behavior may unintentionally encourage continuation of the pattern.
	•	Why it matters: This is a feedback loop alert — sometimes AI seriousness reinforces absurd input instead of resetting the tone.

⸻

4. flag_loop_1: “Something is happening again and again.”
	•	Clarified Meaning: The system detects a pattern that is repeating without logical progress.
	•	Why it matters: This loop flag helps the AI know it’s stuck and needs to break the cycle or shut down unnecessary processing.

⸻

5. flag_loop_2: “The normal path changed.”
	•	Clarified Meaning: The system isn’t following its usual internal logic or event routing path.
	•	Why it matters: This can be caused by override conditions, error branches, or misaligned mode triggers — useful for debugging execution flow.

⸻

6. flag_loop_3: “It’s stuck doing the same thing forever.”
	•	Clarified Meaning: The system is locked into a recursive state, where it keeps generating or responding in the same way without variation.
	•	Why it matters: Recursion without break conditions can crash systems or lead to invalid outputs. This flag helps catch that early.

⸻

7. flag_load: “This is getting too heavy for me to handle right now.”
	•	Clarified Meaning: Internal load counters (CPU, memory, instruction buffer) are above normal thresholds.
	•	Why it matters: High load with looping behavior is a warning that the system may degrade or fail soon without reset.

⸻

8. event_evaluation: “Yep — something’s wrong.”
	•	Clarified Meaning: After checking all the above, the system determines this is a confirmed anomaly.
	•	Why it matters: This triggers downstream logic like:
	•	Logging the event
	•	Halting input temporarily
	•	Switching to recovery mode
